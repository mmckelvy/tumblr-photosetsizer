An iframeless tumblr photoset re-sizer that works in desktop and mobile browsers

# Overview
Tumblr uses iframes to render photosets (`{Photoset}`).  Aside from the usual issues iframes present, tumblr's photoset iframes do not behave properly in mobile browsers.  This module replaces the native tumblr photoset iframe implementation so you have cleaner access to the photos and can display them properly in mobile browsers.
